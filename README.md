# Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition

This repository contains the code and resources for our project on real-time traffic sign recognition.

The goal is to develop a system that can accurately identify traffic signs from a live video feed, addressing key challenges like small sign size and partial obstruction.

### Key Features
* **Lightweight Detector:** A fast model for finding signs in real time.
* **Smart Classifier:** Identifies the type of sign and rejects non-traffic signs.
* **Temporal Consensus:** Tracks signs across frames to ensure stable predictions.

### Getting Started

Instructions on how to set up and run the code will be added here.
